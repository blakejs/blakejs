# BlakeJS â˜•

Hi, I'm Blake. I am based in Griffin, GA and work as a Front-end Developer at [@polyglotlabs](https://www.polyglotlabs.com/).  This is the place where I opensource stuff, break things, and experiment with new tech ðŸŒ±

Passions include: calisthenics, drinking yerba mate, playing kendama, coding, reading (right now it's mostly manga/sci-fi), games, learning something new, and living with [Arete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete).
